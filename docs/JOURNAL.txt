1.FIRST RUN 

1.1 DATA COLLECTION
Dataset for project sourced from *kaggle*. It includes more than 30  features with a mix of numerical, categorical and ordinal values.

1.2 DATA CLEANING
Dropped obviously irrelevant columns(distance from home, gender),
encoded all ordinal categorical data

1.3 CORRELATION MATRIX
To avoid high dimensionality, only features most correlated with attrition have to be selected
for that a correlation matrix was drawn up.

1.4 MODEL  SELECTION AND TRAINING
Due to the high amount of features and the mix of ordinal and numerical features an ANN model was selected.
The features identified as most relevant from the correlation matrix was selected.
And the model was trained
